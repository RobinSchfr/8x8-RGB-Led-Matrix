## Description
A 8x8-RGB-Led-Matrix display is installed in the inside of my PC. The display is programmed through an ESP8266 (a more powerful arduino board). In the IDLE mode it shows different images/logos, but one can also play a decent snake game. I created a small python program, where one can send commands, as keyboard entries, to the microcontroller over the usb/serial interface, because the ESP8266 is connected to the mainboard with a cheap internal usb to usb adapter.
